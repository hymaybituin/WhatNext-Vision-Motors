## üìò Overview

**WhatNext Vision Motors** is a Salesforce-based application designed to simplify and automate vehicle management operations for automotive businesses.  
It enables efficient handling of vehicles, dealers, customers, test drives, and service requests ‚Äî all within a unified platform powered by **Salesforce Lightning**, **Apex triggers**, **batch jobs**, and **automation flows**.

The project highlights Salesforce‚Äôs capabilities in creating **custom objects**, **workflow automation**, and **scheduled background processes** to enhance productivity and business accuracy.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

### üß± 1. Custom Objects
The system includes multiple **custom objects** to represent real-world entities:

- **Vehicle__c** ‚Äì Stores vehicle details such as model, price, and stock quantity.  
- **Vehicle_Dealer__c** ‚Äì Contains information about partner dealerships.  
- **Vehicle_Order__c** ‚Äì Manages customer vehicle purchase records.  
- **Vehicle_Customer__c** ‚Äì Stores customer information and contact details.  
- **Vehicle_Test_Drive__c** ‚Äì Tracks and schedules customer test drives.  
- **Vehicle_Service_Request__c** ‚Äì Logs customer service or maintenance requests.

---

### ‚ö° 2. Lightning App
A **Salesforce Lightning App** was created to integrate all the system components into a single, intuitive interface.  
Users can easily navigate between custom objects and perform key operations such as managing vehicles, dealers, and orders.

---

### üîÑ 3. Automation Flows
Automation flows ensure smoother business operations by reducing manual effort:

- **Auto Assign Dealer** ‚Äì Automatically assigns the correct dealer when a vehicle or order record is created.  
- **Test Drive Reminder** ‚Äì Sends alerts or reminders for scheduled customer test drives.

---

### üß† 4. Apex Classes and Triggers
Custom **Apex code** was implemented to handle backend logic and automated processes.

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `VehicleOrderTriggerHandler` | Contains reusable methods to manage vehicle order logic. |
| `VehicleOrderTrigger` | Trigger that calls the handler when a `Vehicle_Order__c` record is created or updated. |
| `VehicleOrderBatch` | Batch Apex job for processing large sets of vehicle order data. |
| `VehicleOrderBatchScheduler` | Scheduler class that runs batch jobs automatically at defined intervals. |

---

### üßæ 5. Batch and Trigger Jobs
These jobs help maintain system accuracy and automate stock or order-related updates.

**Example Logic:**
> When a vehicle order is created, the system checks if the stock quantity is available.  
> - If **stock quantity = 0**, it prevents over-ordering and can initiate restock notifications.  
> - The batch process ensures data remains consistent and up to date.
